Location: UNSW.

CSE K17, Sydney, Australia, Southern Hemisphere, Earth, uhh.

<u>The year is 2024.</u>  
Elections are soon and Ruchard Bickland is currently giving his election speech. <small>* Not to be confused with Richard Buckland</small>

> Promises

‚úÖ All courses to be pass/fail

üöß Dedicated roads for the 891 (üò≠)

üåå For Pluto to be a planet again.  

üåè Make Tasmania no longer a part of Australia  
(tbh never was)  

---

oh, and COVID-19 is still looming around. <small>wait what</small>  

> COVID-19 RAT tests are affordable,  
> perhaps too affordable ...  

Because of their rather fast results, the government has mandated that every time someone leaves their home, for _any_ sort of reason, they must test themselves - even if multiple times on the same day

---

However, the over-supply and over-use of tests out in public has caused stress on public cleaning services üöÆ. The majority of trash collectors have contracted COVID-19 and have to self-isolate, therefore being out of work, and unable to carry out their duties. Bins aren't being emptied as often as they should.. üß™

> What are some the issues?

> What are the effects on the community?

You feel a tremor... <u>the ground starts to rumble</u>.

But the councillor (Ruchard Bickland) <small>(again, not related to Richard Buckland)</small> assures you that there's nothing to worry about‚Ñ¢. It's just the construction and road works.

> Should you worry?

On some beach near Coogee, the surfers are bored because the tides are <u>way lower than usual</u>. Ruchard tells them to refill the ocean with the spare bottles of Mount Franklin water.

jk UNSW is on a giant slope, so we're fine!

right...?

<img src="rumble/high_ground.jpg" height=250 />

What could go wrong?

{{% note %}}
    Sure we're safe for now, but what about the aftermath?

    * Bio-hazards?
    * Water damage?
    * Sludge?
    * Water pipes, power lines, infrastructural damage?

    How will that impact every day life?

    * No power
    * Buy bottled water
    * Toilet paper?

> Is anyone at fault?

> What does this say about trust?

{{% note %}}
Causality, correlation

Can we trust everything we hear?

Not only think about the immediate consequences of actions, but the effects
