## Tumbler Locks

{{% section %}}

#### The History of Locks

One of the earliest lock designs originates from Egypt (20th Century BC)

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row">
<div>
    <img src="old-locks.png" width="300px" style="margin-right: 30px">
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Made entirely from wood</li>
    <li>Probably flammable</li>
    <li>Rain would be a pain</li>
    <li>Low durability</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Attacker's Toolbox

> Non-destructive methods

* Lock pick
* Torque wrench
* Rakes
* Pick gun
* Bump keys
* Shims

---

### Attacker's Toolbox

> Destructive methods

* Break the shackle (bolt cutter / wrenches)
* Break the lock keyhole (drill)
* Chemicals? Corrosion?
* Break the thing the lock is locking

---

### Picking

![](tumbler-picking-animation.gif)

* Apply a rotational force with the torque wrench
* Find the next pin that is 'binding'
    * Lift that pin
* Repeat

---

> Tip: Donâ€™t put the lock pick too far in!

### <s>Defending</s> Mitigating attacks

{{% section %}}

> No lock is complete secureâ„¢

* Better fundamental designs <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.7em">(i.e. anti-shim)</span>
* Hardened / reinforced inserts <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.7em">(i.e. anti-drill)</span>
* False gates <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.7em">(i.e. reduce low-skill attacks)</span>
* Small / non-standard locks <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.7em">(i.e. require tools)</span>
* MORE PINS
* Multiple pin rows
* Spool pins (next slide)

---

#### Spool pins

Tapered pins interfere with the key cylinder rotation

#### Picking vs Decoding

Picking is temporary, but once you reset the lock you've lost the combination!

Decoding a lock allows you to know the depths so you can recreate a key

## Rotary Locks

<img src="dial-combination-lock-diagram.webp" width=250px>

* Feeling for clicks / movement of the shackle
* Decoders
* Bypassing with levers

---

## Other Locks

* Tubular locks - Impressioning tool <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.7em">(why does this work?)</span>
* Doors
    * Hinge pin tool (or a centre punch and a mallet)
    * Shove tool
* RFID
    * Cloning
    * Spoofing
* Circuitry
    * Physical tampering (buttons, wires, etc..)
    * Fail-safe vs fail-secure design
